Is it Prime?
The Problem
Given an integer, n, determine if it’s prime or not.
The Input
The first line of input will contain a single integer, n (n ≤ 106), indicating the number of values to test for primality. The following n lines will contain one integer each, in between 2 and 107, to test for primality.
The Output
For each input case, output 1, if the number is prime on a line by itself, and 0 otherwise.
