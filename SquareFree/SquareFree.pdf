Square Free Numbers
Filename: sqfree
Danny is afraid of perfect squares, because he once had bad luck on the 1st, 4th, 9th, 16th and 25th of a month. So, whenever he chooses a number for any purpose, he tries to choose numbers that are NOT perfect squares. Help Danny figure out how many numbers he can choose in a particular range.
The Problem
Given a low bound and a high bound, determine the number of integers within those bounds, inclusive, that are NOT perfect squares.
The Input
The first line of the input file will contain a number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10000) indicating the number of ranges to be evaluated. The following n lines will each contain two integers, a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000000) and b (a ≤ b ≤ 1000000).
The Output
For range [a, b], output on a single line the number of integers in the range that are not perfect squares.
